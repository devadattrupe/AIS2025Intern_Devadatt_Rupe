# Week 3 â€“ Day 3: Gallery Page and Smooth Scrolling

## Task 5: Gallery Page using CSS Grid

- Created a responsive image gallery using `display: grid`.
- Each image is placed inside a `<figure>` tag with `<figcaption>`.
- Clicking on an image opens it in a **lightbox modal** with a dark overlay.
- JavaScript handles lightbox open/close and image preview.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5 `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<img>`
- CSS Grid layout
- JavaScript DOM for lightbox functionality

## Task 6: Smooth Scrolling

- Applied `scroll-behavior: smooth` in global CSS.
- Navigation links now scroll smoothly between sections (if applicable).
