# Task 1 - External CSS Styling

In this task, I created an external CSS file and linked it to an HTML page.

I applied different styles to:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Links

The styles were written in a file named `style.css` and linked using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section of the HTML.
