# Task 4 - Hover Effects and Transitions

This task is about adding hover effects and smooth transitions using CSS.

I used:
- `:hover` to change styles when the user hovers on button or image
- `transition` to make the effect smooth

The button grows in size and changes color on hover.  
The image also zooms and changes border color.
