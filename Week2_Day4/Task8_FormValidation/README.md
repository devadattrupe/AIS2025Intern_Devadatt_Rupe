# Task 8 - JavaScript Form Validation

In this task, I created a simple registration form with:

- Name
- Email
- Password

I used JavaScript to check:
- All fields are filled
- Email is valid using pattern
- Password has at least 6 characters

Error messages are shown under each field if something is wrong.
