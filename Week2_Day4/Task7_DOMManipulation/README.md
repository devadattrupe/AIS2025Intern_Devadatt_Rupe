# Task 7 - DOM Manipulation

In this task, I used JavaScript to change the style of a paragraph.

I used:
- `querySelector()` to select the paragraph element.
- `classList.toggle()` to add and remove a CSS class when the button is clicked.

The class changes the background and text color of the paragraph.
