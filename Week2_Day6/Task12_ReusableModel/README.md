# Task 12 - Reusable Modal

In this task, I created a reusable modal using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 Features:
- Modal opens with a button click
- Can be closed with Close button or clicking outside (overlay)
- Includes smooth open animation using CSS `keyframes`

The modal is styled with a white box and overlay background.
