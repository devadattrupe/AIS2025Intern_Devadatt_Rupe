# Task 6 - JavaScript Event Handling

This task uses `addEventListener()` to handle events.

I added:
- A `click` event on a button that shows a message
- A `mouseover` and `mouseout` event on a box that changes color and text

It helps understand how to use events in JavaScript without inline HTML.
