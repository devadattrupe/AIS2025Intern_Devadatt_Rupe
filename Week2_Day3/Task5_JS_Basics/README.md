# Task 5 - JavaScript Basics (DOM and Button)

In this task, I created a button that changes text when clicked.

I used:
- `getElementById()` to select a paragraph
- `.textContent` to change the text
- A button with `onclick` to trigger the function

The new text appears in green when button is clicked.
