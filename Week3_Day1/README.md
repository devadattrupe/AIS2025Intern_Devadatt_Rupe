# Week 3 – Day 1: Final Website Planning and Setup

## Task 1: Final Website Planning
- Decided to create a personal portfolio site named **"My Skills Playground"**.
- The website will contain multiple pages like Home, Gallery, Canvas, To-Do, API Users, Contact, etc.
- The purpose is to showcase all my learning from Week 1 and Week 2.

## Task 2: Setup Project Folder
- Created the base folder structure:
  - `css/` – for all stylesheets.
  - `js/` – for JavaScript functionality.
  - `images/` – for all project images.
  - `pages/` – for separate HTML pages like gallery, contact, etc.
- Linked `main.css` and `main.js` properly in `index.html`.
